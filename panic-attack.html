            <h1>Panick Attack</h1>
            <p><span class="big">It starts as a little tingly feeling</span> in the back of your brain. A warm sensation. On its
                own, it can almost feel nice for a second. But the warmth turns red-hot, it burns and
                starts spreading. And it reaches your heart and your fingers and your legs, and you
                know that you’re dying. It squeezes you like a vise. “This is the end”, you think. Heart
                pounding out of your chest, you can’t breathe. “I’m losing control, am I going to pass
                out? I’m going to die! I’m going insane!” You grasp for a cohesive thought that will
                bring you out of this state, but you can&#39;t focus. And one of the worst parts - the fear
                that builds asking yourself “when is the next time this happens?”</p> <p>Panic Attacks aren’t dangerous in of themselves, but try telling yourself that while
                experiencing one. It’s an extremely scary and, often times, traumatic experience.
                And not uncommon, either. But when you suffer from panic attacks you don’t see
                the others around you that share your pain. Because panic attacks arise and abate
                rather quickly, so you don’t catch many strangers having them. This can make you
                feel like you’re one of the few struggling with this. We treat anxiety and panic all the
                time. In fact, it’s one of the most common conditions and symptoms we treat. And
                we don’t just push a medication your way and tell you to figure it out. While
                medication is an important part to healing, we educate you on how to heal yourself ,
                so you can be less dependant on medication in the future, and also just live to your
                full potential without having these symptoms weigh you down. We don’t simply put
                a band-aid on the problem, but rather we tackle this from multiple angles so that
                you can defeat this on your own.</p>
