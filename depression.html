            <h1>Depression</h1>
            <p><span class="big">It’s difficult for people without depression</span> to truly understand what it feels like. “Just
                be thankful for what you have!”, or, “Fight through it and and focus on the positive.”
                These end up making you feel even worse. Yes, you want to fight it. Yes, you
                understand on a certain level that there is what to be happy for. But you have
                depression, so none of that makes a difference. And being told that you can will your
                way out of it reminds you that someone without this affliction can’t truly understand
                what it feels like.</p> <p>Depression can continue for days, months, and even years until you may look back
                and realize your relationships and health have fallen apart. You’ve given up on things
                you were once passionate about, walking away from many of life’s opportunities
                that were sent your way. It’s understandable, and here’s why…</p> <p>Depression can manifest differently for every person, but there are a few common
                thought patterns, feelings, and physical manifestations that are hallmarks of
                depression. The hallmark symptom is a loss of joy and happiness for things that
                previously gave you those feelings. You may have a complete lack of motivation to
                do anything. Your mind and body “shut down” and you watch the day pass at a
                snail’s pace. You lose interest in friendships, not because you don’t like your friends,
                but you simply can’t burden yourself with other people’s emotions while struggling
                to deal with your own. When you wake up you ask yourself “what’s the point of
                getting out of bed?” You feel as though you literally don&#39;t have the strength to get up
                and face the day…</p> <p>It’s trying to laugh at a joke that isn&#39;t funny; trying to smile for a photo you don&#39;t
                want to be in. It’s having no feelings, which can be worse than feeling sad or angry -
                you want to be angry, but simply don&#39;t have the emotional strength for it. You either
                over-eat, or barely eat anything at all from a complete lack of appetite. There are
                levels to depression and you may have some or all of of the above, and maybe just a
                mild version of it. Everyone has their own unique experience, and that’s why it’s very
                important to us to know exactly what YOU’RE going through.</p> <p>The good news is you’ve taken the very difficult step of seeking help and finding
                treatment. Or maybe you’ve been to other practitioners before, but you weren’t
                helped the way you thought you’d be. We understand. But you’re here now, and we
                can help you. Depression can be managed and treated. Our hundreds of patients
                who are living better than they ever thought possible are a testament to that. Reach
                out and let us help you, and even more so, show you how you can help yourself.</p>
