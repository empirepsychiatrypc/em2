            <h1>PTSD</h1>
            <p><span class="big">PTSD can manifest in a multitude of ways</span> and can be experienced by anyone who
                has had a traumatic experience in their life. The symptoms are not merely
                nightmares and outbursts that are often portrayed on TV.</p> <p>It can feel like you’re always on edge, irritable, uncomfortable around people, locked
                inside yourself, unable to just relax and have fun, unable to feel really positive
                feelings - and if you do, it&#39;s fleeting. All you want is to be yourself, the self you were
                before this changed you. It becomes difficult to understand how anyone can float
                through life doing their schoolwork, or focusing on their job, or going out to bars and
                social events and having fun, when there is so much pain and suffering, and that pain
                and suffering is now a part of you.</p> <p>PTSD can have a large effect on your personal life. To compensate for feeling on
                edge you may bottle up your emotions, which can affect your relationships with
                friends and loved ones. Things you say can come out very dry and almost
                uninterested, even though that’s not how you actually feel. Some may have
                disassociation, which can be extremely scary. Slowly your body starts to drift away
                from yourself, and you start losing control of what you can do. It can be described as
                an out of body experience. This can all lead to deep loneliness.</p> <p>This isn’t something that you can ‘just get over’ through will power. It involves
                reprogramming your brain which takes a lot of hard work! The good news is that it’s
                possible. Through therapy and medication and determined, consistent effort, you
                can heal yourself. You can find your voice again. And you can improve your life. We
                work with you and make sure to individualize your therapy so you can progress at
                your own pace, in a way that makes YOU feel comfortable.</p>
