            <h1>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</h1>
            <p><span class="big">OCD is not a one-size-fits-all</span> diagnosis, and is often greatly misunderstood. There are
                multiple severity levels of OCD and different obsessions and compulsions that you
                could be dealing with.</p> <p>OCD feels like a losing battle against yourself; your brain is your own worst enemy.
                It’s a quest for control that is just out of reach. One of the most frustrating parts is
                you’re aware many of your obsessions aren’t practical. You fight it with logic, but it
                grows stronger. It absolutely will not listen to reason. It laughs at your evidence. It
                plays on your emotions. You want to beat it. You want to crush it - to simply kill it.
                Yet you struggle mightily. It’s exhausting and mentally draining to fight day in and
                day out.</p> <p>There’s checking, washing, counting, tapping, fear of contamination, doubt,
                symmetry, arranging, and unacceptable thoughts. And one of the worst parts is
                feeling alone with this condition. It’s very difficult for someone without OCD to
                deeply relate - and you see it in their eyes when you explain yourself…So you stop
                explaining, and start hiding. It becomes shameful. You know they won’t truly
                understand so why put yourself in a situation where you have to? You don’t go out
                as much, don’t live the life you want to. You know it’s irrational, but there’s a part of
                you that won&#39;t be willing to take the risk of quitting the ritual, just in case this is the
                one time that it isn’t OCD - and there&#39;s a very real threat. It’s the doom-and-gloom
                feeling that overcomes you if the compulsion is not allowed to manifest. And so it
                goes…</p> <p>But you’re not alone. There are many others out there suffering in similar ways. You
                are understood here. Getting treatment is the first, and many times, scariest step in
                beating this and gaining back control. It’s why we go through a comprehensive
                assessment with you to create an individualized treatment plan allowing you to
                improve your life through YOUR own, unique journey.</p>
